Question was taken from the Neetcode webstite ( https://neetcode.io/ )

Problem involved array manipulation, where the goal is to return a new array that is the concatenation of the input array with itself.

Implemented two versions of the solution:
- Used two for loops to manually append each element of nums to a new list twice.
- Optimized the solution by using Python's built-in list concatenation operator +. This achieves the same result in a cleaner and more concise way

Complexity Analysis
- Attempt 1:
  - Time Complexity: O(n) 
  - Space Complexity: O(n) 


- Attempt 2:
  - Time Complexity: O(n) 
  - Space Complexity: O(n) 



Both versions are equally efficient in terms of algorithmic complexity, but the optimized one is more readable.
