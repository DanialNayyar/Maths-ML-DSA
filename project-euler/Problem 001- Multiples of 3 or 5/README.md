This is problem 001 on project-euler ( https://projecteuler.net/archives0 )

The problem involves calcaulating the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000

Created a function that takes in the range (i.e. 1000) and then checks for each number beinga  multiple of 3 or 5 by using the mod operator (%) and then adds them to the recurring total to give a final answer of 233168
