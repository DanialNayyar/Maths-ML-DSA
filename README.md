# Maths-ML-DSA


This repository tracks my learning and problem-solving journey across 4 major areas:

1. **Deep Learning / Machine Learning**
2. **Project Euler (Math-heavy problem solving)**
3. **LeetCode & Neetcode (DSA & Interview prep)**
4. **HackerRank (Programming, SQL, AI, certifications)**

Each folder contains:
- âœ… My solution files (Mainly Python, C++)
- ðŸ“˜ Notes & insights


## Folder Structure

| Folder        | Purpose                           |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| `deep-ml`    | Machine & Deep Learning practice   |
| `project-euler` | Math & logic problem solving     |
| `leetcode-neetcode`   | DSA + coding interview questions   |
| `HackerRank/` | Challenges, SQL, AI, competitions  |


This repo will be updated regularly as I learn and solve new problems
